What to do in Self Bootcamp Crypto Winter
1. Check the latest news
2. Analyze on-chain transaction
3. Coding Smart contract and frontend

How to learn above and how long spend each topics
1. Catch up the lates news on Twitter, Discord and crypto media such as decrypto, coindesk and the block.
Also, pick up new algorithm or technology on Github. It's better for coding also.
I recommend 0-7% of the day (less than 1 hour).
2. Analyze on-chain transaction using Messari, DappRader, Defillama and Dune Analytics.
I recommend 5-10% of the day (0.5-1.5 hours).
3. Coding, Coding, Coding!
It depends on which chain and eco system you want. EVM or non-EVM.
It's better choice learning Solidity on EVM. Lots chain used that. But you can use EVM on Solana like NEON EVM.
If you choose RUST building on Solana, it's good too. I decided to launch on Solana and learn RUST.
And lots protocols think to build on Solana from EVM chains. So RUST developers need by them.

We learn React, Typescript and Next.js for frontend.
Scrimba has good tutorial for React. I recommend it.
Most parts spend coding until you get in bed.
